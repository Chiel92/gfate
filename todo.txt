 Todo's for gfate.
===================

 Important todo's
------------------
Search support.
The tab vs space thing - don't user fate's string directly, but it's "view string" / "display string".


 Other todo's
--------------
Settings gui.
Fully functional scrollbars.
Undo tree support.
Colour scheme porting (also improve fate-core's syntax highlighting).
Settings generate fate and gfate resource files - and open in explorer/nautilus.
Code folding.
Drag/drop files.
Fix crash when it's resized too small.
Bugfix mouse clicks (position to coord and vice versa are not that reliable)
Use fates view file (get rid of most pos_to_coord calls and fixes the currently terrible selection displays :P) (wontfix? I like my own)

Ubuntu:
- Fix on resize event.



 Todo's for fate.
==================

"Sorry: IdentationError: ..."

Ctrl-n en Ctrl-p: Ctrl-Tab and Ctrl-Shift-Tab (Ctrl-Backtab). (subject: tab switching)
PageUp and PageDown buttons don't work (Ctrl-b and Ctrl-f do, so why not add something for the page up and down buttons as well?)
0 (zero - home) should go to beginning of line with or without whitespace (as in a toggle)
- (minus, next to 0 (zero); so next to 'home') should be 'end' (the $ in vim)

vims :TOhtml command
Code folding.
Cross platform line endings
vims 'r' command
empty lines (with spaces)
backspace on tab/'4 spaces'
Tabs vs spaces
Moving up or down over empty line should preserve original index in line.
Tabs + listchars (tab display & trailing space display).
O and o reversed?
undo to saved undo part should remove the * in the name?
Crash when input is not in keymap
Auto scrolling when moving up or down scrolls (way) too early.
Ctrl-Down (or J) means End, and Ctrl-Up (or K) means Home?
When searching, n or N doesn't wrap. So if you are at the last match, and you press n it won't go to the first match on the page.

A sort of 'e' command that moves up to the next capital letter (or end of word, so also include things like _ to stop)
same for w and others
