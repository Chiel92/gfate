 Todo's for fate.
==================

"Sorry: IdentationError: ..."

Ctrl-n en Ctrl-p: Ctrl-Tab and Ctrl-Shift-Tab (Ctrl-Backtab). (subject: tab switching)
PageUp and PageDown buttons don't work (Ctrl-b and Ctrl-f do, so why not add something for the page up and down buttons as well?)
0 (zero - home) should go to beginning of line with or without whitespace (as in a toggle)
- (minus, next to 0 (zero); so next to 'home') should be 'end' (the $ in vim)

vims :TOhtml command
Code folding.
Cross platform line endings
vims 'r' command
empty lines (with spaces)
backspace on tab/'4 spaces'
Tabs vs spaces
Moving up or down over empty line should preserve original index in line.
Tabs + listchars (tab display & trailing space display).
O and o reversed?
undo to saved undo part should remove the * in the name?
Crash when input is not in keymap
Auto scrolling when moving up or down scrolls (way) too early.
