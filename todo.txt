 Todo's for fate.
==================

Ctrl-n en Ctrl-p: Ctrl-Tab and Ctrl-Shift-Tab (Ctrl-Backtab). (subject: tab switching)
PageUp and PageDown buttons don't work (Ctrl-b and Ctrl-f do, so why not add something for the page up and down buttons as well?)

Code folding.
Cross platform line endings
vims 'r' command
empty lines (with spaces)
backspace on tab/'4 spaces'
Tabs vs spaces
Moving up or down over empty line should preserve original index in line.
Tabs + listchars (tab display & trailing space display).
