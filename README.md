gfate
=====

A GUI for Chiel92's fate text editor, strongly influenced by both vim and sublime text.
For the backend source code check [fate][fate] and for a more up to date terminal interface,
see [tfate][fate-tui] (it might not work on windows though).

Installation
------------
Make sure you have all dependencies installed: `tkinter` and `PIL`.

For ubuntu: `sudo apt-get install python3-pil.imagetk python3-tk`
For windows: `pip install Pillow`

And possibly you need to `pip install requests`

Run with: `python3 gfate foo.py bar.py`
